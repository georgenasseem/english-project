        </div>

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">How does YouTube work? YouTube is one of the biggest social media platforms. Moreover, it provides a simple way for people to store videos and share them. Furthermore, YouTube uses a complex algorithm made up of over one million lines of code. Additionally, when u search for a video, the algorithm decides which search results it will show you and in what order. In addition to, YouTube’s definition of view is a viewer initiated intentional play of a video. How are views counted in YouTube? A view is counted when 2 criteria are met:  A user intentionally initiates the watching of a video and if a user watches a video for 30 seconds it is counted as a view.</h3>

        </div>
          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Introduction:<br>
            Recently, our teacher asked us to write a report on the uses of YouTube in society and give suggestions on how it can be improved.<br><br>
              
            Findings:<br>
            YouTube is a social media platform which is used by people of all ages around the world. It can be used for entertainment or business purposes and provides useful information which can be shared by anyone. First off, YouTube is a free and easy to use platform where all kinds of information can be shared online by using an account. It also gives you the opportunity to make money by making videos through views, sponsorships, merch, etc. Secondly, for businesses or students, YouTube is the best way to communicate with a large audience as you can share information or promote brands. Videos are a fast and effective way to convey messages. However, not all of the information and products are real or true and might be harmful. So you have to be careful of what you view. Moreover, There is a lot of ads which reduce watching experience.<br><br>
              
            Recommendation:<br>
            I think YouTube is good for society and I suggest that there should be less ads and all information should be reviewed.<br><br>
